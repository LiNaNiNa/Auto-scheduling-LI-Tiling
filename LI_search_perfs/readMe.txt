This notebook aims to test the k-best (k=5) prediction model for the Loop Interchange transformation. 
The targeted metric: search performance. 
The used method: simulation of Beam search on the benchmark.
This notebook can be used on multiple computations Tiramisu functions as well as single computation ones.
